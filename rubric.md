## Project Feedback + Evaluation

#### Project Workflow:

  > Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Performing/Excelling -**
A few of the bronze level stories like 'have a successful match stay flipped so I can concentrate' probably isn't necessary for an MVP and might be better as 'silver'. Overall though, your user stories are succinct and pretty well scoped. I also really like how you included what parts of the wireframe pertain to the MVP and which are extra.

#### Technical Requirements:

  > Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Excelling -**
You created a bunch or really nice, well functioning features that all add to the user experience. The execution of these features leverages the material we've covered and then some. I'm glad you were able to knock out your silver features and some of your gold ones. Great job!

#### Code Quality:

  > Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did > you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Excelling -**
All of your variables have nice semantic names, good use of indentation, and helpful comments throughout. The only suggestions I'd make is to try to think about how to split up some of the longer functions and reduce the amount of nesting. Also, thinking about starting to move your script and css files into separate folders 'js' & 'stylesheets'.

#### Creativity/Interface:

  > Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

**Excelling -**
Your game looks great, and all of the features you added really contribute to improving the experience of users playing the game. It's fun to be able to switch themes and difficulty levels and then race against the clock. The winning animation is a nice touch - I added a comment on how this could be improved with CSS animations.

#### Total:

**Excelling -**
Really fantastic job through and through. I'm glad you pushed yourself to tackle some more complex problems beyond the MVP and I'm impressed to the solutions to you came up with to the problems that arose in doing so. The 'busy' property is a nice solution to checking if a timed function is still occurring. We will go more in-depth into the asynchronous nature of javascript later in the class and talk about potentially better ways to solve similar problems using promises. Keep it up! ðŸ˜ƒ
